# FeatureSelectionUsingGA
This project uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to enhance feature selection for a neural network classifying emotions from the RAVDESS Facial Landmark Tracking dataset, focusing on distinguishing happy and sad emotions. The goal is to refine the neural network's predictive accuracy by iteratively selecting the most informative facial landmarks.
